# food2-api

[![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=food2-api&style=flat&svg=1)](https://food2-api.herokuapp.com/)

This was a simple proof-of-concept to provide CORS support for an external api...

It's deployed on heroku (see badge above).

It supports the get & search api's on food2fork and both require a POST.
